    <p><strong>These muffins are delicious!</strong></p>
    <p>Made these exactly as written and they were a hit! I brought them to work and they all disappeared within the hour, some people going back for seconds and thirds! The topping is a nice touch and really adds to the overall flavor. This made exactly 12 muffins. A great way to use up those less-than perfect strawberries.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup butter, softened</li>

        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1.5 cups chopped strawberries</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>

        <li>Beat 3/4 cup sugar and butter together in a mixing bowl using an electric mixer until creamy. Add egg and mix well.</li>

        <li>Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups. Combine 3 teaspoons sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl and sprinkle over tops of muffins.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
